IDEAS FOR DESIGN:
controller scheme, add DONE
add sidesteps (no iframes, just move the player)
enemy parry has stamina. After stamina runs out, they are open to stagger from attacks
normal enemies parry less, bosses are parry heavy.
projectiles for bosses? instead of parry, attack to cut them, or just have to sidestep
cinematic sweeping camera shots of the level, with enemies lined up to fight
